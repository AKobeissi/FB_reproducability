The decrease was primarily driven by higher research and development expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The company also reported higher production costs due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The decline in operating margin was offset by a 4.5% increase in revenue, driven by growth in the company's personal care and electronics segments.\n\nIf operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like 3M, then it is because it does not accurately reflect the company\u2019s profitability and growth prospects. 3M is a diversified company with a wide range of products and businesses, including industrial, healthcare, and consumer goods. The company's operating margin can be affected by various factors, such as changes in raw material costs, currency fluctuations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains and production costs.\n\nFurthermore, operating margin is not a useful metric for companies with high levels of research and development (R&D) spending, such as 3M.

This suggests that Adobe's revenue growth has been driven by its subscription-based model, which has provided a stable source of recurring revenue.

The quick ratio is a liquidity measure that is more relevant to larger, more diversified companies. In the case of a company like AMCOR, there may be other liquidity measures, such as the cash and cash equivalents to total debt ratio, that would be more relevant to financial analysts. Therefore, a financial analyst may not consider the quick ratio to be a key metric for evaluating AMCOR's financial health. \n\nThe quick ratio is a liquidity metric that measures a company's ability to pay its short-term debts using its liquid assets. It is calculated by dividing the company's quick assets (current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses) by its current liabilities. A higher quick ratio indicates that a company has more liquid assets than it has short-term debts, which can provide a cushion against liquidity shortages. The quick ratio is particularly useful for companies with a high proportion of inventory or prepaid expenses, as these",

Operating margin is a useful metric for companies with high fixed costs and low variable costs, but it is less useful for companies with low fixed costs and high variable costs. Companies with high fixed costs, such as AMEX, should focus on increasing revenue and controlling costs.\nAccording to the AMEX 2022 Annual Report, the company's operating margin is improving as of 2022.

In contrast, companies like Apple (or Best Buy) have gross margins that are consistently high and historically consistent (e.g., Apple's gross margin has been around 38% for the last few years). The idea that gross margins are an important metric for a company like Best Buy may be a common assumption, but it may not be accurate. \nThere are several reasons why gross margins may not be a relevant metric for a company like Best Buy. First, Best Buy is a retailer, not a manufacturer. As a retailer, Best Buy does not have control over its costs of goods sold (COGS), and therefore, its gross margins are largely determined by the prices that Best Buy sets for its products. Since Best Buy's prices are determined by market conditions, it is likely that the company's gross margins will fluctuate from year to year as market conditions change. \nSecond, Best Buy is a company that sells both new and used products. The prices of new and used products are likely to be different, and therefore, the gross margins for Best Buy will be different depending on the type of product sold. For example, the gross",

As of FY2022, Boeing's gross margin has improved from 13.4% in FY2018 to 14.5% in FY2022.  This represents an increase of 1.1% over the 4-year period.  Gross margin has also improved as a percentage of sales, from 13.1% in FY2018 to 14.3% in FY2022.  While Boeing's gross margin has improved, it is still below the average of its industry peers.

One reason is the company's dependence on commercial aircraft production, which is affected by changes in global economic conditions, such as recessions and booms. During economic downturns, aircraft demand decreases, leading to reduced production and lower revenue. Conversely, during economic expansions, demand increases, and production increases, resulting in higher revenue and profits. This cyclical nature of the business is evident in Boeing's historical performance, with the company experiencing significant declines in sales and earnings during the 2008-2009 recession and subsequent recoveries during periods of economic growth. As a result, investors and analysts closely monitor Boeing's business and make adjustments to their expectations and valuations accordingly.
