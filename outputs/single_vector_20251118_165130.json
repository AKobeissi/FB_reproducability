These increases were primarily due to special item costs related to PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)-related matters, as well as the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which impacted cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses.\n\nIf operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like 3M, then please state that and explain why. Operating margin is a useful metric for many companies, as it measures the profitability of a company's operations after accounting for the direct costs of producing and selling its products. However, operating margin may not be as useful for companies like 3M, which is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator, and marketer of a wide variety of products and services.\n\n3M's business segments are diversified across various industries, including electronics, healthcare, and consumer goods. As a result, the company's operating margin may be influenced by various factors, such as changes in product mix, pricing, and volume, which can make it challenging to analyze and compare operating margins across different segments",

It is calculated as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, excluding certain items such as inventory and prepaid expenses.\n\nTo calculate the quick ratio for 3M's Q2 FY2023, we need to look at the relevant financial statement data. According to the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of June 30, 2023, 3M had:\n\n* Current assets: $15,754 million\n* Current liabilities: $14,688 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the quick ratio:\n\nQuick Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities\n= $15,754,000,000 / $14,688,000,000\n= 1.08\n\nBased on this calculation, 3M's quick ratio for Q2 FY2023 is 1.08. This suggests that the company has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as it has a sufficient amount of liquid assets to cover its short-term debts.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the quick ratio is not a perfect measure of liquidity, as it excludes certain items such as inventory and prepaid expenses.

This is evident from the following points:\n\n* 3M has paid dividends since 1916 and has declared a dividend increase for 65 consecutive years.\n* In February 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent.\n* In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, maintaining the same dividend rate as the first quarter.\n* The Company has a repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of its outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date.\n\nOverall, 3M's consistent dividend increase and ongoing repurchase program suggest a stable trend of dividend distribution, indicating that the company is committed to returning value to its shareholders.",

The average value of PP&E for FY2019 can be calculated by taking the average of the opening and closing PP&E values.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the revenue for FY2019 from the statement of income.\nFrom the statement of income, we can see that the total revenue for FY2019 was $7,443 million.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the average PP&E value for FY2019.\nThe PP&E value at December 31, 2018, was $2,433 million, and at December 31, 2019, it was $2,675 million. The average PP&E value is the sum of these two values divided by 2.\n\nAverage PP&E value = ($2,433 million + $2,675 million) / 2 = $2,554 million.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio for FY",

Assuming the operating margin is the difference between Revenue and COGS, and the operating margin for 2022 is $530 million, we can calculate COGS as: COGS = Revenue - Operating margin = $3,060 million - $530 million = $2,530 million.\n- Average Inventory: Not explicitly stated, but we can calculate it by taking the average of the beginning and ending inventory values. We'll need to calculate the beginning and ending inventory values.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the beginning and ending inventory values.\nTo calculate the beginning and ending inventory values, we need to refer",

(0.83)\nC. $0.81\nD. $0.82\n\nExplanation: To find the return on assets (ROA) for AES, you must divide the company's net income by the average of its total assets for the years 2021 and 2022. According to the statement of financial position, AES's total assets for 2021 were $7,525 million and for 2022 were $7,575 million. The average of these two numbers is $\\frac{7,525+7,575}{2}$ = $7,550 million. The net income for 2022 was $(546)$ million. Thus, the ROA for AES is $\\frac{(546)}{7,550}$ = 0.0718, which rounds to 0.07 when rounded to two decimal places.\nThe correct answer is C. $0.07.\nThe best answer is C. $0.07.",

To do that, we need to know the beginning and ending balances of accounts payable for each of the two years. The balance sheet for FY2016 shows accounts payable of $25,309, and the balance sheet for FY2017 shows accounts payable of $34,616.\nTo find the average accounts payable, we can use the midpoint of the beginning and ending balances. We can do this by adding the beginning and ending balances and dividing by 2.\nAverage accounts payable = ($25,309 + $34,616) / 2 = $29,462.50\nNow that we have the average accounts payable, we can calculate the DPO for FY2017.\nWe can find the COGS by looking at the P&L statement. The COGS is $48,866.\nWe can also find the change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017 by looking at the balance sheet. The inventory balance for FY2016 is $11,461, and the inventory balance for FY2017 is $16,047. We can find the change in inventory by subtracting the beginning inventory from the ending inventory.\nChange in inventory =",

      "generated_answer": "The relevant information is in the \"Income Statement\" section of the filing. Amazon's net income is stated as $11,588 million in the FY2019 statement. This is the total net income, including all components of net income. However, the question asks for net income attributable to shareholders. To calculate this, we need to subtract the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (which is zero in this case).\nNet income attributable to Amazon's shareholders = $11,588 million\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests = $0\nNet income attributable to shareholders = $11,588 million + $0 = $11,588 million\nTherefore, Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders was $11,588 million. Note that this is the same as the total net income for FY2019. The reason for this is that the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is $0 in this case. It is possible that in some cases, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests could be significant, and in that case, the net income attributable to shareholders would be lower than the total net income.\n[END OF ANSWER]The final answer is: $11,588.",

We can calculate this ratio for both FY2023 and FY2022 based on the information in the financial statements. For FY2023, the calculation is as follows:\n$\n689 + 1,875 = 2,564\n2,564 / 13 = 196.92\nFor FY2022, the calculation is as follows:\n$\n775 + 1,935 = 2,710\n2,710 / 14 = 193.57\nSince 193.57 is greater than 196.92, the quick ratio has declined from FY2022 to FY2023.\nTherefore, answer: The quick ratio has declined between FY2023 and FY2022. The financial analyst might ask about the liquidity position of the company, but the quick ratio is a specific metric that is used to assess the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. This metric is relevant to the company's financial position and may be of interest to investors and analysts. \n\nNote: The information provided is based on the specific filing provided and may not reflect the company's current financial position or other relevant information. \n\nPlease let me know if you",

      "generated_answer": "Based on the above filing, the restructuring liability of AMCOR as of Q2 of FY2023 close is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer the value of the restructuring liability from the information provided.\n\nAccording to the filing, the restructuring liability balance as of December 31, 2022 was $93. This value is likely to be the same as the value as of Q2 of FY2023 close, given the relatively short time period between the two dates.\n\nAdditionally, we can see that the net charges to earnings for restructuring costs were $2 in Q2 of FY2023. This suggests that the restructuring liability is decreasing over time.\n\nTaking these factors into account, we can estimate the restructuring liability as of Q2 of FY2023 close as follows:\n\n* Restructuring liability balance as of December 31, 2022: $93\n* Net charges to earnings for restructuring costs in Q2 of FY2023: $2\n* Assuming the net charges to earnings remain constant for the remaining 6 months of Q2, the total net charges to earnings for the quarter would be $4.\n* Therefore, the estimated restructuring liability as of Q2 of FY2023 close would be: $93 - $4 = $89.",

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not\\nbe relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will\\noccur.

In May 2022,\\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products.

In February 2022, we completed our strategic\\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

AMD is a semiconductor company that designs and manufactures microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and other semiconductor products. The company's operating margin is a critical metric that reflects its ability to control costs and maintain pricing power in a highly competitive market.\n\nThe decrease in operating margin as of the FY22 for AMD is primarily driven by a decrease in gross margin, which was due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Additionally, operating income decreased due to higher operating expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in operating income from the Client segment.\n\nIn terms of the Embedded segment, the company experienced a significant increase in revenue due to the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. However, this growth was partially offset by a decrease in Client segment revenue.\n\nOverall, the decrease in operating margin as of the FY22 for AMD is primarily due to a combination of factors, including amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition, lower revenue, and higher operating expenses.

This means we need to look at the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and All Other segments.\n\n## Step 2: Determine the sales increase for each segment\nFrom the provided information, we can see that the Data Center segment had a significant increase in sales due to higher semi-custom product sales. The Client segment had a decrease in sales primarily due to lower processor shipments. The Gaming segment's sales are not explicitly mentioned. The All Other segment is not a reportable segment, so we can exclude it.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the sales increase in the Data Center segment\nThe Data Center segment's sales increase was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue. This suggests that the Data Center segment had a significant sales increase, but the extent of the increase is not specified.\n\n## Step 4: Determine the segment with the highest sales proportion increase\nBased on the information provided, it appears that the Data Center segment had the highest sales proportion increase, but the exact percentage increase is not specified.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the impact of the X",

To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant information in the filing.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the relevant information\nFrom the filing, we can see that the company reported net income of $7.5 billion in 2022, which is a decrease from the previous year. We also know that operating expenses increased 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with Amex Ventures equity investments.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the information\nSince the net income decreased, and operating expenses increased, it is likely that the operating margin (net income divided by revenue) decreased as well. However, the filing does not provide a direct comparison of the operating margin between 2022 and the previous year.\n\n## Step 4: Consider alternative perspectives\nAs the filing states, \"If we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase.\" This suggests that the company's focus on short-term incentives might impact its long-term",

According to the filing, the main driver of the gross margin change is the increase in billed business, which increased 24% year-over-year. This increase in billed business is likely due to the growth of American Express's network and the expansion of merchant acceptance.\n\nHowever, as the filing mentions, gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like American Express. The reasons for this are:\n\n*   Card Member rewards expense growth was driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel.\n*   Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel.\n*   Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel.\n\nThese factors suggest that the gross margin change is not solely due to changes in the cost of goods sold or operating expenses, but rather is also influenced by changes in the mix of revenue streams and the growth of new businesses. Therefore, gross margin may not be a useful metric for evaluating the performance of American Express. \n\nNote that the filing",

      "question": "Was American Express able to retain card members during 2022?",
      "reference_answer": "Yes",
      "gold_evidence": "{'evidence_text': 'Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions', 'doc_name': 'AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 44, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic.\\nSpending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology,\\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\\ninternational billings.\\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1 \\n42\\n'}",

The working capital can be calculated as follows:\nWorking capital = Total current assets - Total current liabilities\n= $1,250 million - $1,554 million\n= -$304 million\nTherefore, based on FY2022 data, American Water Works has negative working capital.\nBased on the data, working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company. This is because the company has a significant amount of short-term debt ($1,175 million) and long-term debt ($10,929 million) compared to its current assets ($1,250 million) and current liabilities ($1,554 million).

To calculate the 3 year average net profit margin, we need to divide the 3 year average net earnings by the 3 year average revenue.\nThe 3 year average net earnings is 1,228 + 897 + 1,233 = 3,258.  The 3 year average revenue is 39,528 + 40,339 + 40,611 = 120,478.  The 3 year average net profit margin is 3,258 / 120,478 = 0.027 or 2.7%.  This is the net profit margin for Best Buy for the FY2015 - FY2017 3 year period.  The net profit margin is 2.7%. \nAnswer (2.7%).\nThe best answer is 2.7%.",

However, the report provides the net income, operating income, and revenue for the three years ended January 28, 2023. To estimate Best Buy's gross margins, we need to use the revenue and net income figures.\n\nAccording to the financial statements, Best Buy's revenue for the three years ended January 28, 2023, is as follows:\n\n* 2022: $52.93 billion\n* 2021: $48.79 billion\n* 2020: $41.87 billion\n\nTo estimate the gross margin, we can use the formula:\n\nGross Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) x 100\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the estimated gross margin for the three years ended January 28, 2023:\n\n* 2022: (10.25 billion / 52.93 billion) x 100 = 19.4%\n* 2021: (6.83 billion / 48.79 billion) x 100 = 14.0%\n* 2020: (4.45 billion / 41.87 billion) x 100 = 10.7",

This growth has \\nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment.

This is the cash inflow from the revenues minus the cash outflow from the costs of the company. To calculate this, we need to know that the company's net income was $213,105 thousand and its cost of revenue was $6,764,169 thousand. Therefore, the cash inflow from the revenues was $213,105 thousand + $6,764,169 thousand = $6,977,274 thousand. The cash outflow from the costs of the company was $6,764,169 thousand. Therefore, the cash flow from operating activities was $6,977,274 thousand - $6,764,169 thousand = $213,105 thousand. This can be calculated as follows:\n$6,977,274 (thousand) - $6,764,169 (thousand) = $213,105 (thousand) (thousand)\n\\(\\frac{\\$213,105,\\text{(thousand)}}{\\$6,977,274,\\text{(thousand)}}\\times 100\\%=30.6\\%\\)\nTherefore",

During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice\\nthat resolved the Department of Justices previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal\\nAviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company\\nreceiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and\\nservices operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to\\npromote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\\non Embraers failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is\\ncurrently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration, which we currently expect to\\nbe completed in late 2023 or early 2024.\\nNote 22 Segment and Revenue Information\\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segments operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\\nthe information contained in this report.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\\n6\\n'}\n\n{'evidence_text': 'We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government', 'doc_name': 'BOEING_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 9, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely\\ndeliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the\\nfinancial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production\\ndelays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\\nappropriations bills.\\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\\n8\\n'}\n\n{'evidence_text': 'In 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts', 'doc_name': 'BOEING_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 13, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nguarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or\\nfinancial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there\\nis no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\\nand/or cash flows.\\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\\nthe information contained in this report.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\\n6\\n'}",

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\\ncertification and production schedules.\\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability.

We can find these numbers in the balance sheet and P&L statement. The balance sheet shows total assets of $87,896 million and the P&L statement shows net income of $1,182 million. We can calculate the ROA using the formula ROA = (net income / (average total assets)).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the average total assets between FY2016 and FY2017. We can find this by taking the average of the total assets in the two years. The total assets in FY2016 were $87,270 million and in FY2017 were $87,896 million. The average of these two numbers is ($87,270 + $87,896) / 2 = $87,583 million.\n\nNext, we can plug in the values we have found into the ROA formula. ROA = ($1,182 / $87,583) = 0.0135 or 1.35%.\n\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1.35%}$\n\nNote: The answer is rounded to two decimal places as requested in the problem.",

This is\\ndriven by 15% growth in segment net sales in Optical Communications of $674 million and 34% growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million,\\nwhich helped offset a $394 million decrease in Display Technologies.

When compared to 2021, the $590\\nmillion decrease was primarily driven by a $238 million increase in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges, a $50 million increase\\nin litigation, regulatory and other legal matters and a $120 million adverse impact from foreign currency translation.\\n \\nDiluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.26 per diluted share, or 20%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021,\\nprimarily driven by the immediate repurchase and retirement of 35 million common shares which resulted in an $803 million one-time reduction to net income available\\nto common shareholders in 2021, partially offset by the decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as described above.

From the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we can extract the average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018: average PP&E = $137,899 million.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio.\nThe fixed asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the FY2018 revenue by the average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018. Therefore, the fixed asset turnover ratio = $194,579 million / $137,899 million.\n\n## Step 4: Perform the calculation.\nFixed asset turnover ratio = $194,579 million / $137,899 million = 1.41.\n\n## Step 5: Round the answer to two decimal places.\nRounded fixed asset turnover ratio = 1",

The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\\ncourts.\\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\\nby the Cherokee Nation.\\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC).

The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs.

I can help you extract relevant information if you would like.)\n\n## Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the filing for the gross margin change.\nTo determine the gross margin change, we need to examine the change in gross profit and cost of products sold over the years. Gross profit is the difference between sales to customers and cost of products sold.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the gross margin for FY2022 and FY2021.\nTo calculate the gross margin, we subtract the cost of products sold from the sales to customers for each year. For FY2022: $63,854 (gross profit) - $31,089 (cost of products sold) = $32,765. For FY2021: $63,920 (gross profit) - $29,855 (cost of products sold) = $34,065.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the gross margin percentage for FY2022 and FY2021.\nTo calculate the gross margin percentage, we divide the gross profit by the sales to customers and multiply by 100. For FY2022: ($63,854 / $94,943) * 100 = 67.4%. For FY2021: ($63,920 / $",

You will also need to find the information in the \"Sales to customers\" line item in the \"Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings\" table in the filing.  Once you have the information, you can calculate the percent of net earnings to sales by dividing the net earnings by the sales to customers and multiplying the result by 100.  You can also use the percent of net earnings to sales line items in the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" table in the filing to simplify the calculation.\nThe percent of net earnings to sales was 10.1% in Q2 of FY2022 and 20.1% in Q2 of FY2023.  Since 20.1% is greater than 10.1%, the answer to the question is no, JnJ's net earnings as a percent of sales did not increase in Q2 of FY2023 compared to Q2 of FY2022.  However, the percent of net earnings to sales was 10.1% in Q2 of FY2022 and",

We maintained an annual\\ndividend of $0.01 per share throughout 2022. On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends\\nin light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan.

The net change in cash and equivalents is equal to the cash and equivalents at the end of the year minus the cash and equivalents at the beginning of the year. \n\nLooking at the data, we can see that the cash and equivalents at the beginning of the year is $8,574 million and the cash and equivalents at the end of the year is $7,441 million. Therefore, the net change in cash and equivalents is -$1,133 million. \n\nSince the question asks which activity brought in the most (or lost the least) cash flow, we need to determine if the net change in cash and equivalents is a loss or an inflow. Since it is a loss, we know that the investing activity brought in the least amount of cash flow. \n\nTherefore, the investing activity brought in the least amount of cash flow in FY2023.\n\nThe best answer is investing.",

Acquisitions\\nTrillium\\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\\nArray\\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.', 'doc_name': 'PFIZER_2021_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 69, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\\ntax liability.\\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\\nT. Share-Based Payments\\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\\nNote 2.

We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since\\nthe lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which\\nconsisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\\ndevelopment expenses.', 'doc_name': 'PFIZER_2021_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 70, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\\nArrays portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-\\nlicensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020.

In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\\ndevelopment expenses.\\nB. Divestitures\\nMeridian\\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\\nfinancing arrangements.\\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\\nbanking fees.\\nPfizer Inc.\\n2021 Form 10-K\\n65\\n'}",

Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\\nsection within MD&A.\\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1.

This agreement is consistent\\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\\ncustomary closing conditions.\\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms.

This decline was due to the impact of unfavorable changes in channel mix and the decline in net price of Inflectra, a product for the treatment of psoriasis.  The decline in the International region was the largest percentage decline of the four geographic regions.  The biggest decline in the U.S. region was 27%, while the biggest decline in the Global Biopharmaceuticals Business (Biopharma) segment was 51%.  The decline in the Biopharmaceuticals segment was due to the decline in Comirnaty and Paxlovid, which are both COVID-19 treatments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\nGENERAL\\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\\nsection within MD&A.\\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\\ncustomary closing conditions.\\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\\n38\\n'}",

Instead, it reports a total company basis, indicating that its chief operating decision maker does not regularly review asset information by operating segment.\n\n## Step 2:  Look for any indication of Pfizer spinning off large business segments.\nIn the filing, there is no indication that Pfizer is spinning off any large business segments. The Transforming to a More Focused Company Program is mentioned, which includes restructuring costs and other activities to align the cost base with the operating structure, but this does not appear to involve spinning off business segments.\n\n## Step 3:  Review the Product Developments section to see if it provides any information about Pfizer's business segments.\nThe Product Developments section mentions that a comprehensive update of Pfizer\u2019s development pipeline was published as of August 1, 2023, but it does not provide any information about the company's business segments.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{No}$",

      "generated_answer": "The increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories balance at end of FY2023 can be attributed to several factors. One key factor is the strong demand for beauty and personal care products, which led to a surge in sales and inventory levels. Another factor is the company's strategy to invest in its e-commerce platform and fulfill online orders, which required additional inventory storage and management. Additionally, Ulta Beauty's expansion into new markets and geographic regions may have contributed to the increase in merchandise inventories. Furthermore, the company's focus on offering a wide range of products and services, including salon services and beauty classes, may have led to an increase in inventory levels to support these offerings. Finally, the company's efforts to maintain a strong brand image and customer loyalty may have resulted in a desire to hold onto inventory levels, rather than selling them off. Overall, the increase in merchandise inventories balance at end of FY2023 can be attributed to a combination of these factors. \n\nNote: The text provided appears to be a combination of two different reports, one from Ulta Beauty's 13-week Q4 FY2023 earnings report and the other from their 52-week FY2023 earnings report.

In Exhibit 1, the relevant information is found in the \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" and \"Gross profit (as a percentage of net sales)\" lines. In the FY2023 period, the relevant information is:\n- Selling, general and administrative expenses: $762.7 million\n- Gross profit (as a percentage of net sales): 37.6%\nNow, we need to calculate the wages expense as a percent of net sales. The gross profit is 37.6% of net sales. The gross profit is equal to net sales minus cost of sales. We know that the gross profit is $4,044.5 million and the net sales are $10,208.6 million. We can calculate the cost of sales as follows:\nCost of sales = Net sales - Gross profit\n= $10,208.6 million - $4,044.5 million\n=",

As \\nof December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of our investments without readily determinable fair values were \\n$808 million and $402 million, respectively. During 2021, there were approximately $66 million of adjustments due to observable price \\nchanges and insignificant impairment charges. Cumulative adjustments due to observable price changes and impairment charges were \\napproximately $143 million and $63 million, respectively. \\nVerizon has a liability for contingent consideration related to its acquisition of Tracfone, completed in November 2021. The fair value is \\ncalculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model and represents a Level 3 measurement. Level 3 instruments include \\nvaluation based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other \\nmarket participants. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting date, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured to fair \\nvalue with changes recorded within Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income. \\nFixed income securities consist primarily of investments in municipal bonds. The valuation of the fixed income securities are based on the \\nquoted prices for similar assets in active markets or identical assets in inactive markets or models that apply inputs from observable market \\ndata.

Although such transactions are excluded \\nfrom the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these \\ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \\ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \\nregarding Corporate and other results. \\nCapital Expenditures and Investments \\nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \\ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \\ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \\nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \\nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \\nin the information economy. \\nGlobal Network and Technology \\nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \\nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \\nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \\nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \\nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \\nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \\nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \\nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \\navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \\nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \\nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \\nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \\nboth 4G and 5G customers. \\nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \\nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \\nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \\nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \\naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \\nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\\nefficient manner. \\nConsolidated Results of Operations \\nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \\nresults.
