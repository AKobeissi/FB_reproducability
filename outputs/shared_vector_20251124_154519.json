From the filing provided:\n\n- For FY2018, the value under \"Purchases of property, plant and equipment\" is $(1,577) million.\n\nThis figure represents the capital expenditures made by 3M during the fiscal year 2018. Therefore, the FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M is **$1,577** million (USD). Note that the negative sign indicates a use of cash, which is consistent with capital expenditures being a cash outflow. Hence, the actual amount spent is $1,577 million. \n\nIt's worth noting that the filing also mentions that in 2018, 63% of 3M\u2019s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. This additional context provides insight into how the capital expenditure was distributed geographically.

Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to\ncapacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as\ninformation technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\n \nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures.

Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for\nsignificant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics\ncosts, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled\noperations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant\nlitigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately\n$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring\ncharges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost\nmanagement.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application\ndevelopment, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.\nGain on Business Divestitures:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen\nCorporation. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nGoodwill Impairment Expense:\nAs a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced\nMaterials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business). Refer to Note 15 for further details.\n27\n"

If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.\nHere is the relevant filing that you need to answer the question:\n[START OF FILING]\n:\n \nOperating income margins increased 1.0 percentage points for the full year 2017 when compared to the same period last year.\n \n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company\u2019s former identity management\nbusiness.\n \nOrganic volume/productivity and other:\n\u00b7\nOperating income benefited from higher organic local-currency sales growth and productivity, partially offset by actuarial adjustments to the\nCompany\u2019s respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual.\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher year-on-year defined benefit pension service cost expense.\n\u00b7\nOperating margins also decreased due to incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges\nrelated to 3M\u2019s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.\n \nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\u00b7\nAcquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integratio\n\n15 million. Both the June 2018 and December 2018 divestiture impacts were reported within\nthe Company\u2019s Electronics and Energy business.\n \nRefer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2017 and 2016, resulting in gains of $586 million and $111\nmillion, respectively. Refer to Note 3 for additional detail on these divestitures.\n \nOperating Income Margin:\n \n3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating\nincome margins for 2018 and 2017.\n28\n\nwhen compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and declined 2.3 percentage points in full\nyear 2018 when compared to full year 2017.\n \nAdditional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in operating income margins follows:\n \n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to the gain on the May 2017 divestiture of the Company\u2019s former identity management\nbusiness.\n \nOrganic volume/productivity and other:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins increased year-on-year due to benefits from organic local-currency growth and productivity, in addition to lower year-\non-year portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges.\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins decreased year-on-year due to higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined\ncontribution expense.\n \nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n\u00b7\nAcquisition impacts (primarily related to Scott Safety), in addition to lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding t\n\nng income margins increased 0.2 percentage points year-on-year, benefiting from expenses related to portfolio and footprint actions taken\nin 2017 that were not repeated in 2018. \n \nYear 2017 results:\n \nSales in Consumer totaled $4.7 billion, up 3.3 percent in U.S. dollars. Organic local-currency sales increased 2.7 percent, while foreign currency translation\nincreased sales by 0.6 percent.\n \nOn an organic local-currency sales basis:\n\u00b7\nSales grew in consumer health care, home improvement, and home care.\n\u00b7\nThe stationery and office supplies business declined due to channel inventory adjustments, primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale\nmarket.\n \nOperating income:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins declined 1.8 percentage points year-on-year, in part due to incremental strategic investments, which reduced margins\nby 1.8 percentage points.\n \nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AR EA\n \nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Compan\n\noss profit margin provides investors with useful information\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning\ndecisions and in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance.\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.3 percent in 2021 from 59.3 percent in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and favorable\nchannel and package mix as well as the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021, partially offset by the impact of increased commodity\nand transportation\n45\n[END OF FILING]"
