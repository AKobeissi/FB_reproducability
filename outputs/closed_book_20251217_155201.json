The investing activities section includes all cash outflows for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) acquisitions, and other capital expenditures. The amount of cash outflow for PP&E acquisitions is given in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement as (1,344) million. Therefore, the FY2018 capital expenditure amount (in USD millions) for 3M is 1,344.\n\\begin{tabular}{l c}  & 1,344 \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c}  & 1,344 \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\\\",
