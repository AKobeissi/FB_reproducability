      "generated_answer": "To determine the FY2018 capital expenditure amount for 3M, I would need to refer to their cash flow statement for that fiscal year. However, as I don't have direct access to real-time financial documents, I will guide you through the process of finding it:\n\n1. Obtain 3M's annual report or 10-K filing from a reliable source like the SEC website or 3M's official investor relations page.\n2. Navigate to the \"Cash Flow Statement\" section, which can usually be found in the financial statements part of the annual report.\n3. Look for a line item called \"Cash Flows from Investing Activities\" or \"Investing Cash Flows.\"\n4. Within this section, find the specific line item labeled \"Capital Expenditures,\" \"Purchases of Property, Plant, and Equipment,\" or something similar.\n\nThe exact figure should be listed there. As of my last update, the amount for FY2018 was approximately $2,765 million (USD). However, for the most accurate and up-to-date information, please consult the actual financial document. \n\nPlease provide the actual document if you need a precise answer based on the latest available data.
