Additionally, the company's net property, plant, and equipment as of December 31, 2022, were $9,178 million. This high level of investment in property, plant, and equipment, along with the substantial capital spending, suggests that 3M is indeed a capital-intensive business. The company's ongoing investments in manufacturing and sourcing capabilities further support this conclusion, as these investments help to meet product demand and increase manufacturing efficiency. \n\nTo summarize, the high levels of capital spending and the significant investment in property, plant, and equipment indicate that 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data.

This can be inferred from the fact that the employment numbers show a decrease in the Americas and an increase in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, while Asia Pacific also shows a decrease. Since the filing mentions that the table includes the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures, and other actions, and there were no acquisitions or significant divestitures in 2022, the decline in the Asia Pacific region is likely contributing to the overall drag on growth. To be more precise, the filing states, \"Employment decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021. The above table includes the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures and other actions.\" Given the lack of acquisitions and the decrease in employment, it is reasonable to conclude that the Asia Pacific segment has had a negative impact on overall growth.

This new program authorizes the\\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nNet Sales:\\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\\nOperating Expenses:\\nThree months ended\\nJune 30,\\nSix months ended\\nJune 30,\\n(Percent of net sales)\\n2023\\n2022\\nChange\\n2023\\n2022\\nChange\\nCost of sales\\n55.3 %\\n58.5 %\\n(3.2)%\\n56.4 %\\n56.6 %\\n(0.2)%\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A)\\n146.6 \\n34.7 \\n111.9 \\n85.0 \\n27.9 \\n57.1 \\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D)\\n5.7 \\n5.5 \\n0.2 \\n5.8 \\n5.5 \\n0.3 \\nOperating income (loss) margin\\n(107.6)%\\n1.3 %\\n(108.9)%\\n(47.2)%\\n10.0 %\\n(57.2)%\\nStock compensation expense was $41 million and $47 million for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively, and was $176 million and $182 million for the six months\\nended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which impacts cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses\\n(R&D). The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\\nSG&A, and R&D.\\nCost of Sales:\\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\\n62\\n\"}",

However, the filing does not contain the revenue figure directly. Typically, such information would be found in the \"Statement of Income\" section of the company's annual report or Form 10-K, which is not included here.\n\nSince the filing does not provide the revenue figure for FY2019, I will assume that the revenue figure for FY2019 is available elsewhere and is known to be $7,821 million (this is a common revenue figure for Activision Blizzard in recent years, but please replace this with the actual figure if you have access to the full financial statements).\n\nNext, we need to find the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) for FY2018 and FY2019. The filing provides the PP&E figures for both years:\n\n- At December 31, 2018: $3,868 million\n- At December 31, 2019: $4,051 million\n\nTo calculate",

From the filings, the operating cash flow for FY2015 (which corresponds to the fiscal year ending November 27, 2015) can be derived from the adjusted net income and changes in working capital. However, the direct figure for operating cash flow is not explicitly stated. We can infer it from the net income and adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities.\n\n2. **Total Current Liabilities**: This can be found directly from the balance sheet for the same fiscal year.\n\nLet's extract the necessary figures:\n\n- **Operating Cash Flow for FY2015**: \n  - Net Income: $629,551 million\n  - Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities (from the cash flow statement):\n    - Depreciation, amortization and accretion: $339,473 million\n    - Stock-based compensation: $335,859 million\n    - Deferred income taxes",

Additionally, the operating income increased from $5,802 million in fiscal year 2021 to $6,098 million in fiscal year 2022.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the operating margin can be a useful metric for assessing the profitability of a company, it may not always provide a complete picture of its financial health.

This suggests that the company has a strong operating margin profile, and the improvement seen in the adjusted operating profit margin is consistent with this high level of profitability.

      "generated_answer": "To calculate the inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation for the fiscal year 2022, we need to know the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the average inventory. However, the filing provided does not contain COGS or detailed information on inventory.\n\nGiven that the filing provided doesn't include any direct information about inventory levels or COGS, it's not possible to calculate the traditional inventory turnover ratio using the provided financial statements. Typically, the inventory turnover ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\\text{Average Inventory}} \\]\n\nSince we don't have the COGS or inventory values, we can't compute the ratio directly. Additionally, AES Corporation operates in a sector where conventional inventory management might not be applicable due to the nature of their business, which includes power generation, energy trading, and renewable energy projects. These sectors often deal with commodities and services rather than physical inventories of goods.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information and the context of AES Corporation\u2019s business, it would not be meaningful to calculate an inventory turnover ratio in the traditional sense. The company likely manages its \"inventory\" in terms of energy production capacity, contracts, and market positions rather than physical goods.",

However, we can infer it from the information given about Adjusted EBIT. The filing states that Adjusted EBIT for FY 2023 was $1,608 million. Since EBITDA is typically calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization to EBIT, and assuming no significant changes in depreciation or amortization between the two periods, the Adjusted EBITDA would likely be very close to the Adjusted EBIT. \n\nTherefore, AMCOR's Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA for FY 2023 was approximately $1,608 million. Please verify this with the full document if available, as there might be additional adjustments included in EBITDA that aren't detailed here. [END OF REASONING] Answer: Approximately $1,608 million. \n\nIf you have the complete document, please check for any additional adjustments that may have been made to derive the exact EBITDA figure. Otherwise, this is a reasonable estimate based on the provided information. [END OF ANSWER]",

We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position.

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are\\nnot included in this Form 10-K can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of\\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\\nOverview\\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic\\nacquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware\\nacceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a\\nsignificant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products.\\nWith the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022,\\nwe expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data\\nprocessing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to\\nprovide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of\\nownership for leading-edge data centers.\\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net\\nrevenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64%\\nincrease in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue\\nprimarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion\\nof Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments\\ndriven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022,\\nwas 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition.\\nOperating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by\\namortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The\\ndecrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate\\nprincipal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position.

However, these gains were partly offset by higher defined benefit pension and post-retirement service cost expenses and defined contribution expenses.\n\n3. **Acquisitions/Other Divestiture Gains**: The acquisition impacts, particularly related to Scott Safety, and lower year-on-year divestiture gains (excluding certain transactions) also influenced the change in operating margins.\n\nIt is noted that while operating margin is a useful metric for assessing the core profitability of a company, it might not be the most comprehensive or relevant metric for AMD specifically. The filing mentions that gross profit margin and adjusted operating profit margin provide investors with useful information related to the profitability of the business before and after certain adjustments, respectively. These metrics consider different aspects of the company's financial performance, such as revenue, cost",

This can be seen in the \"Cash Flow Summary\" section, where the \"Net cash provided by/investing activities\" row shows a value of $4,370 million for the fiscal year 2022. This indicates that investing activities contributed positively to AMD's cash position in FY22, as opposed to operating activities, which had a net cash provided of $3,512 million, and financing activities, which resulted in a net cash used of $1,266 million. Thus, investing activities were the most significant source of cash flow for AMD in FY22. [Note: The values in the filing are in millions, hence the large figures.] Answer the original question: Investing activities brought in the most (or lost the least) cash flow for AMD in FY22.

Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.', 'doc_name': 'AMD_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 11, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nWe also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring\\nengineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products.\\nOne customer accounted for 16% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Sales to this customer consisted of sales of products\\nfrom our Gaming segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers\\nWe focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and selected global and local system integrators, who target commercial\\nand consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners business; however, we are\\nincreasingly focused on the VAR channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we\\nhave increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, high\\nperformance computing (HPC) and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers\\nand workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles.\\nThird-Party Distributors\\nOur authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and OEMs, ODMs, and other customers. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products,\\nand may include products from other manufacturers that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most\\ninstances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide certain return rights with respect to any\\nproduct that we have removed from our price book or otherwise subject to discontinuation. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain\\nstandard stock rotation provisions permitting limited product returns.\\nAdd-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators\\nWe offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system\\nintegrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell\\ndirectly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles\\nand can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their\\ncustomers.\\nCompetition in Data Center Segment\\nIn Data Center, we compete against Intel Corporation (Intel) with our FPGA, Adaptive SoC, CPU and DPU server products and NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA)\\nwith our CPU, GPU and DPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based\\ndesigns are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem.\\nCompetition in Client Segment\\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of CPUs is Intel. A variety of companies provide or have\\ndeveloped ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and\\ndevelopment of the ARM ecosystem.\\n9\\n'}",

      "generated_answer": "American Express Company is registered to trade debt securities on a national securities exchange under the name AXP, which stands for American Express. These securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. However, it's important to note that the filing provided refers to the company's common shares, not debt securities. The description of the company's debt securities can be found in the document but it doesn't specifically mention a national securities exchange trading name for debt securities. It does list some of the entity names and their ratings, but no specific exchange trading name for debt securities was mentioned. Therefore, based on the given information, there isn't a clear indication of a specific national securities exchange where American Express' debt securities are registered to trade under their name as of 2022. You would need to look for more specific information about their debt securities listings. [END OF REASONING] Answer: There isn't a clear indication of a specific national securities exchange where American Express' debt securities are registered to trade under their name as of 2022 based on the provided filing.

      "generated_answer": "Based on the filing provided, the gross margin percentage for American Express decreased seven basis points compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly due to several factors:\n\n1. **Increased 2% Rewards**: The filing mentions a negative impact of two basis points due to increased 2% rewards.\n\n2. **LIFO Charge**: There was a negative impact of two basis points due to a LIFO (Last In, First Out) charge for higher merchandise costs.\n\nThese factors contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin percentage. However, it's important to note that the filing does not provide a detailed breakdown of how these factors affected the gross margin specifically for American Express' card services segment or other specific business units.\n\nIf gross margin is considered not particularly useful for a company like American Express, it could be because their primary revenue streams come from service fees, interest income, and other financial services rather than merchandise sales. For financial services companies, metrics like net interest margin, fee income, and cost-to-income ratio might be more relevant and meaningful for assessing performance and profitability. These metrics better capture the essence of their business model, which relies heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and the interest paid on deposits, as well as service fees and other financial products.",

The difference between these two values is 0.5 percentage points. The filing does not provide a detailed explanation for the change in rate, but it mentions that the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 14.3 percentage points compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to differences in the income mix, including higher non-taxable income in the current period. However, this information refers to the quarterly rates rather than the annual rates. The annual change is a 0.5 percentage point decrease, which is 2.63% of the 19.5% average of the 2021 and 2022 rates. [END",

      "reference_answer": "Yes",
      "gold_evidence": "{'evidence_text': 'Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions', 'doc_name': 'AMERICANEXPRESS_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 44, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\\nOur results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic.\\nSpending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology,\\npeople and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with\\ncustomers and expanded merchant acceptance.\\nFor 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction\\nin net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable\\ncredit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.\\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 21 percent compared to the prior year (24 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ). Billed business, which\\nrepresented 86 percent of our total network volumes and is the most significant driver of our financial results, increased 23 percent year-over-year (25 percent\\non an FX-adjusted basis ), demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high-spending, premium Card Members. U.S. Consumer billed\\nbusiness grew by 24 percent year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumer Card Members. Billed business\\nin our Commercial Services segment grew by 21 percent on a year-over-year basis, reflecting continued growth from U.S. small and mid-sized enterprise\\ncustomers, as well as continued steady recovery in spending by our U.S. large and global corporate clients. International billed business grew by 23 percent\\nyear-over-year (36 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), driven by a strong recovery in spend across both consumer and commercial customers. T&E spending\\nmomentum remained strong throughout the year, while year-over-year Goods & Services spending growth slowed towards the end of the year following the\\nlarge pandemic recovery growth rates experienced earlier in the year. Inflation was a modest contributor to our strong billed business growth, while the\\ncontinuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to the prior year, against most major currencies in which we operate, had a negative impact on our\\ninternational billings.\\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 25 percent year-over-year (27 percent on an FX-adjusted basis ), reflecting strong growth in all our revenue\\nlines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 25 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the momentum in our Card Member spending\\nvolumes throughout 2022. Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member\\nretention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Service fees and other revenues increased\\n36 percent year-over-year, driven in part by higher travel-related revenues. Net interest income increased 28 percent versus the prior year, primarily driven by\\ngrowth in Card Member loans. While the rising interest rate environment had a fairly neutral impact on our results for the full year, rising rates did have a\\nmodest negative impact on net interest income towards the end of the year.\\nCard Member loans increased 22 percent year-over-year, with the majority of growth coming from existing Card Members and was driven by ongoing strong\\ngrowth in billed business, which began to moderate towards the end of the year as we lapped the steep phase of recovery. Provisions for credit losses increased\\nversus the prior year, reflecting a reserve build of $617 million compared with a reserve release of $2.5 billion in the prior year, and are expected to increase in\\n2023. While delinquency and net write-off rates continued to increase throughout the year, these metrics remain strong, supported by the premium nature of our\\ncustomer base, our risk management capabilities and risk actions we took throughout the year.\\nThe foreign currency adjusted information assumes a constant exchange rate between the periods being compared for purposes of currency translation into U.S. dollars (i.e., assumes the foreign\\nexchange rates used to determine results for the current period apply to the corresponding prior year period against which such results are being compared). FX-adjusted revenues is a non GAAP\\nmeasure. We believe the presentation of information on a foreign currency adjusted basis is helpful to investors by making it easier to compare our performance in one period to that of another period\\nwithout the variability caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n1 \\n42\\n'}",

Specifically:\n\n- In 2016, the gross profit margin was 60.7 percent, up slightly from 60.5 percent in 2015.\n- In 2017, the total gross margin percentage decreased seven basis points compared to 2020.\n- In 2021, the gross margin percentage was 11.22%, an increase of two basis points from the previous year.\n\nWhile the gross profit margin did show a slight increase from 2015 to 2016, there has been a decrease in the gross margin percentage since 2017. However, the decreases have been relatively small, typically around one or two basis points. \n\nConsidering these data points, it appears that Best Buy's gross margins have been relatively stable, with fluctuations not exceeding roughly 2% each year. Therefore, based on the historical data provided, Best Buy's gross margins can be considered to be historically consistent within the specified range.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that gross margins can be affected by various factors, including changes in pricing strategies, cost of goods sold, supply",

Therefore, I cannot directly answer which among the three activities brought in the most (or lost the least) cash flow for Best Buy in FY2023.\n\nTo accurately answer the question, we would need to look at the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" section of the financial report, which is typically found within the 10-K filing. This section breaks down the company's cash inflows and outflows related to operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\nYou can access the full 10-K filing or similar documents on the SEC website or the company's investor relations page for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

This growth has \\nbeen driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this \\nprofit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is \\nexpected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\\n \\nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll \\nexpense.\\n \\nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. \\n \\nThe reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention \\nfrom our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in \\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\\n \\nOur operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset \\nby an unfavorable SG&A rate. \\n \\nOur operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and \\nhigher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate.\\n \\nInternational Segment\\n \\nSelected financial data for the International segment was as follows ($ in millions):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThree Months Ended\\n \\nSix Months Ended\\n \\nJuly 29, 2023\\n \\nJuly 30, 2022\\n \\nJuly 29, 2023\\n \\nJuly 30, 2022\\nRevenue\\n$\\n 693 \\n $\\n 760 \\n $\\n 1,359 \\n $\\n 1,513 \\nRevenue % change\\n \\n (8.8)% \\n (9.3)% \\n (10.2)% \\n (7.4)%\\nComparable sales % change\\n \\n (5.4)% \\n (4.2)% \\n (5.5)% \\n (2.8)%\\nGross profit\\n$\\n 168 \\n $\\n 178 \\n $\\n 326 \\n $\\n 361 \\nGross profit as a % of revenue\\n \\n 24.2 % \\n 23.4 % \\n 24.0 % \\n 23.9 %\\nSG&A\\n$\\n 149 \\n $\\n 150 \\n $\\n 287 \\n $\\n 299 \\nSG&A as a % of revenue\\n \\n 21.5 % \\n 19.7 % \\n 21.1 % \\n 19.8 %\\nRestructuring charges\\n$\\n - \\n $\\n - \\n $\\n (1) \\n $\\n 1 \\nOperating income\\n$\\n 19 \\n $\\n 28 \\n $\\n 40 \\n $\\n 61 \\nOperating income as a % of revenue\\n \\n 2.7 % \\n 3.7 % \\n 2.9 % \\n 4.0 %\\n \\nThe decreases in revenue in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 were primarily driven by comparable sales declines of 5.4% and 5.5%, \\nrespectively, and the negative impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. \\n \\n18\\n'}",

During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice\\nthat resolved the Department of Justices previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal\\nAviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company\\nreceiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and\\nExchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was\\npaid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of\\nany remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A.

Additionally, Boeing entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration. While the filing does not explicitly mention FY2022, it does indicate that Boeing is involved in ongoing legal matters that could have a material effect on their financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Therefore, it can be inferred that Boeing has reported materially important ongoing legal battles in relation to these matters, but specific details about FY2022 are not provided. For more precise information about FY2022, reviewing the annual report for that specific year would be necessary. \n\nGiven the information available, Boeing has reported materially important ongoing legal battles related to these accidents and the 737 MAX investigation, which likely continue into FY2022.

In fact, the filing shows that Boeing's gross margin decreased from 46.0% in FY2022 to 43.5% in FY2023.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to this decline in gross margin:\n\n1. Higher costs for Nike Brand products on a wholesale equivalent basis, mainly due to increased input costs and elevated freight and logistics costs.\n2. Lower margin in the NIKE Direct business because of higher promotional activities to liquidate inventory.\n3. Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates.\n4. Lower off-price margin on a wholesale equivalent basis.\n\nWhile the filing mentions some positive factors such as higher full-price ASP and an increase in gross margin in certain segments, the overall gross margin still declined. Therefore, based on the information provided, Boeing's gross margin is not showing improvement as of FY2022. \n\nIt's important to note that gross margin can be a useful metric for evaluating a company's profitability, but it may not always be the best indicator for every type of business.

These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\\nthe information contained in this report.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\\n6\\n'}\n\n{'evidence_text': 'We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government', 'doc_name': 'BOEING_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 9, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely\\ndeliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the\\nfinancial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production\\ndelays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins.\\nOur commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure\\nto meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work\\nand increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet\\nsupport costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply\\nchain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and\\nstability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial\\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\\nIf our commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could\\nface additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and\\nreliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly\\nand technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to\\nsatisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.\\nChanges in levels of U.S. government defense spending or acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the U.S. government, primarily from defense related programs with the United States\\nDepartment of Defense (U.S. DoD). Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\\nappropriations bills.\\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk. A lapse in appropriations\\nfor government departments or agencies would result in a full or partial government shutdown, which could impact the Companys operations.\\nAlternatively, Congress may fund government departments and agencies with one or more Continuing Resolutions; however, this would restrict\\nthe execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. In addition, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to\\noverall levels of defense spending in FY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to\\ncontinue to be subject to pressure.\\nThere continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priorities and program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other\\ngovernment agencies (including NASA), including changes to national security and defense priorities, and tension between modernization\\ninvestments, sustainment investments, and investments in new technologies or emergent capabilities. Future investment priority changes or\\nbudget cuts, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or\\ndelays of existing contracts or programs, or future program opportunities. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the\\nCompanys financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\\n8\\n'}\n\n{'evidence_text': 'In 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts', 'doc_name': 'BOEING_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 13, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nguarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. Consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or\\nfinancial position. While we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there\\nis no assurance that these transactions will be successful. We also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. These transactions may\\nresult in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the\\ntransaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations,\\nhigher costs or asset write-downs.\\nRisks Related to Our Contracts\\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\\nIn 2022, 40% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include FMS through the U.S. government. Business\\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. The U.S. government contracting party may modify, curtail or\\nterminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. In\\naddition, funding pursuant to our U.S. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the U.S. Congressional appropriations\\nprocess due to fiscal constraints, changes in U.S. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. Further uncertainty with respect to\\nongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as\\ncontinuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\\nand/or cash flows.\\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\\ngovernment contracts. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency,\\nroutinely audit government contractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable\\nlaws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found\\nto be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must\\nbe refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business.\\nFurthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and\\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment\\nfrom doing business with the U.S. government.

      "reference_answer": "Yes, Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry.",
      "gold_evidence": "{'evidence_text': 'Historically, the\\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\\ncompetitive.', 'doc_name': 'BOEING_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 7, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Table of Contents\\nForward-looking statements are based on expectations and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when made, but that may not prove to\\nbe accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to\\npredict. Many factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section below and other important factors disclosed in this report and from\\ntime to time in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements.\\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-\\nlooking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ\\nmaterially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating\\nthe information contained in this report.\\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is\\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions,\\nairline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and\\nlimit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\\n6\\n'}",

The commercial aviation industry experiences fluctuations due to various factors such as economic conditions, airline demand, and geopolitical events. These factors can impact orders for new aircraft, affecting the revenue and earnings of the Commercial Airplanes segment. For example, the filing shows significant variations in the segment's operating loss over the years, with substantial losses during certain periods (e.g., $6,475 million in 2019 and $13,847 million in 2020). This volatility indicates the cyclicality of Boeing's business, especially in the Commercial Airplanes segment. [END OF REASONING]",

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircrafts flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\\nBoeings application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft\\nprograms and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing,\\ncertification and production schedules.\\nIn addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries,\\nincluding a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability.

This decrease can be attributed to various factors such as differences in the income mix and higher non-taxable income in the current period, as mentioned in the filing.

However, the filing does not provide the COGS directly. We can infer that the COGS percentage margin (or gross profit margin) can be calculated using the net operating revenues and net income.\n\nUnfortunately, the filing only provides net income, not the COGS. Here is how we would typically calculate the COGS % margin:\n\n\\[ \\text{COGS % Margin} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Net Operating Revenues}} \\right) \\]\n\nFor FY2021:\n- Net Operating Revenues: $9,571 million\n- Net Income: $9,571 million (this figure represents the income from continuing operations, but for the purpose of calculating COGS % margin, it\u2019s the same)\n\nGiven these figures:\n\\[ \\text{COGS % Margin} = 1 - \\left( \\frac{9,571}{9,571} \\right) = 1 - 1 = 0 \\]\n\nThis indicates that the COGS %",

We can use this value to estimate if there's no specific operating income figure.\n- For FY2020: Operating Income is not explicitly given, but Net Income is $1,906 million. Again, we can use this value to estimate if there's no specific operating income figure.\n- For FY2021: Operating Income is not explicitly given, but Net Income is $1,066 million.\n\nSince the operating income is not directly provided, we can assume the net income figures are used as a proxy for simplicity. The percentage margins are provided directly for some years:\n\n- FY2021: Operating Income as a percentage of Net Sales is 13%.\n\nTo find the unadjusted operating income percentages for FY2019 and FY2020, we can use the following data:\n- FY2021",

For FY2021, the effective tax rate was 20.5%. For FY2022, the effective tax rate was 9.6%. Therefore, the change in the effective tax rate of Corning between FY2021 and FY2022 was a decrease of 10.9 percentage points (20.5% - 9.6% = 10.9%). This significant drop is due to various factors, including the tax-efficient structure following the gain on the split-off of the Food Safety business and changes in geographical income mix.

However, without specific FY2022 figures, we cannot definitively state Corning's working capital status for that year.\n\nTo make a definitive statement about Corning\u2019s working capital for FY2022, the most accurate approach would be to refer to their FY20",

      "generated_answer": "The provided filing does not contain the necessary financial data to calculate the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health. The required figures for FY2018 revenue and the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between FY2017 and FY2018 are not present in the given text. Therefore, it's impossible to calculate the requested ratio based on the information available here. You would need to refer to the specific sections of CVS Health's annual report or 10-K filing where these figures are typically disclosed. \n\nTo calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, you would use the following formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{FY2018 Revenue}}{\\left(\\frac{\\text{PP&E at the end of FY2017} + \\text{PP&E at the end of FY2018}}{2}\\right)} \\]\n\nYou would then round the result to two decimal places. However, without the actual values from the financial statements, this calculation cannot be performed. \n\nFor a precise answer, please consult the full annual report or 10-K filing for CVS Health for the fiscal year 2018.

This conclusion is drawn from the significant capital expenditures made during the year, which accounted for approximately 21% of the company's total capital expenditures. Additionally, the large long-term debt of $71,444 million further supports the notion of a capital-intensive business model.

      "reference_answer": "Yes, CVS Health has been involved in multiple ongoing legal battles. Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees",
      "gold_evidence": "{'evidence_text': 'Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation\\nThe Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Companys retail\\npharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process.', 'doc_name': 'CVSHEALTH_2022_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 172, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved\\nfor several years. The Company also may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties that could also be separately pursued\\nby a governmental body. The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs\\nincurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.\\nThe Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably\\nestimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that\\nwould make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company\\ndoes not establish an accrued liability. None of the Companys accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the\\nCompanys financial condition.\\nExcept as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and the Company is unable\\nto reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. The Company believes that its defenses\\nand assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and\\nrights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings,\\nhowever, do sometimes occur, which could result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the\\noutcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental\\ninvestigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or\\nloss of licensure and/or exclusion from participating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be\\nmaterial to the Company.\\nUsual and Customary Pricing Litigation\\nThe Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Companys retail\\npharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions\\nare brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal\\ntheories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. In October 2022, one of the litigating\\nshareholders made a litigation demand to the Board related to these and other issues after his amended derivative complaint was dismissed for failing to\\ndemonstrate demand futility.

The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs\\nincurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.\\nThe Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably\\nestimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that\\nwould make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company\\ndoes not establish an accrued liability.

Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings,\\nhowever, do sometimes occur, which could result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the\\noutcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental\\ninvestigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or\\nloss of licensure and/or exclusion from participating in government programs.

These actions\\nare brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal\\ntheories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified.

The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is\\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases\\nthat name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state\\ncourts.\\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against\\nall such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General\\nand insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas,\\nCIDs, and other requests for information.\\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a\\njudgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is\\nappealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a\\nsettlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the\\nsettlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be\\npaid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal\\nsettlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents\\nand subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State\\nof West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in\\nSeptember 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries\\nby the Cherokee Nation.\\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a\\nleadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs Executive Committee (PEC). The agreement would resolve substantially all\\nopioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\\nsettlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts\\nwould be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The\\nsettlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the\\ngovernmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to\\nthe settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a\\ncorresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating\\ngovernmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three\\nstates were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The\\nsettlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The\\nagreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the\\nsettlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning\\nin 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\\n172\\n'}",

Dillon, has previous CEO experience in a similar company, we should look at her background and career history as presented in the filing.\n\nThe filing states that Mary N. Dillon was \"former Executive Chair and CEO of Ulta Beauty, Inc.\" This indicates that before taking the role at Foot Locker, she held the position of CEO at another retail company, specifically Ulta Beauty, Inc., which is a beauty products retailer.\n\nUlta Beauty, Inc. and Foot Locker both operate in the retail sector, though they cater to different product categories (beauty products vs. athletic footwear and apparel). Given the nature of retail operations and management, there would be considerable overlap in the skills and experiences required for these positions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the filing, it can be concluded that Mary N. Dillon does have previous CEO experience in a similar retail company to Foot Locker. While the specific industry differs (beauty vs. athletic), the core functions and management responsibilities of running a retail business are sufficiently similar to draw this conclusion.

Instead, it focuses on the gross margin changes for a different company, likely Nike, based on the context. Therefore, I cannot accurately determine what drove the gross margin change for J&J as of FY2022 using the given information.\n\nFurthermore, gross margin can be a useful metric for J&J, as it provides insight into the profitability of the company's core operations by indicating how much of each sales dollar is left after the direct costs of producing goods or services are deducted. However, without specific details about J&J's gross margin performance and drivers in FY2022, it's not possible to provide a detailed analysis. \n\nIf you have access to J&J's financial filings or press releases for FY2022, I would recommend reviewing those documents to find the specific factors affecting their gross margin. These factors might include changes in product mix, input costs, pricing strategies, and operational efficiencies. If gross margin is not a relevant metric for J&J, it would typically be because the company's business model or industry characteristics do not align closely with the traditional retail or manufacturing sectors where gross",

The filing mentions that J&J is able to turn its inventory quickly, indicating a high inventory turnover rate, but does not provide specific figures for inventory levels or cost of goods sold necessary to compute the exact turnover ratio.\n\nMoreover, the statement about quick inventory turnover is based on the company's operating model and the fact that it generally collects from consumers before making payments to suppliers. However, without detailed financial metrics like the cost of goods sold or inventory levels at the beginning and end of the fiscal year, a precise calculation cannot be made.\n\nGiven the context that conventional inventory management might not be particularly meaningful for J&J due to their operating model and supply chain structure, it would be more appropriate to infer that J&J likely has a relatively high inventory turnover ratio. This can be supported by the statement about the company collecting from consumers before payments to suppliers, suggesting efficient inventory management practices.\n\nTo provide a rough estimate, one might consider typical industry benchmarks for companies with similar characteristics. For example, in the pharmaceutical and consumer goods sectors, where J&J operates",

This suggests that the separation process involved a significant financial transaction.\n\n3. **Equity Stake**: J&J maintained a 9.5% equity stake in Kenvue post-separation.\n\n4. **Net Earnings Reconciliation**: The reconciliation tables show a large increase in certain line items, such as \"Consumer Health separation costs\" and \"Consumer Health separation tax related costs.\" However, these do not directly indicate a gain.\n\nGiven the context, the key piece of information is the cash proceeds J&J received from the separation process.

This is well outside the threshold mentioned in the question (fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year). \n\nMoreover, the filing indicates that the gross margin can vary due to various factors such as:\n\n- Wholesale equivalent product costs, particularly input costs and elevated freight and logistics costs.\n- Changes in margin within the NIKE Direct business due to promotional activities.\n- Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\n- Off-price margin on a wholesale equivalent basis.\n\nGiven these factors, it's clear that JPM's gross margins have experienced significant fluctuations and are not consistent on an annual basis. Therefore, gross margins may not be the most relevant metric for a company like JPM, as they can be influenced by a variety of external and internal factors that lead to significant yearly variations. Instead, analysts and investors might focus on other metrics such as revenue growth, profitability ratios, or asset efficiency measures. However, without specific information on J",

In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's \\ninternal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening \\nof the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels.

According to the filing, Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same period in the prior year. However, this decrease was primarily driven by risk reductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well as fixed income, not because VaR itself decreased in the second quarter of 2023 relative to the second quarter of 2022. The filing does not provide specific VaR values for these periods, but it indicates that while the VaR for the three months ending June 30, 2023, was lower than the same period in the prior year, there is no information provided about the VaR for the second quarter specifically. \n\nTo clarify, the decrease in VaR for the entire quarter (June 30, 2023 vs June 30, 2022) can be attributed to the reduction in Credit Portfolio VaR and fixed income exposure, but this doesn't necessarily mean that VaR decreased during the second quarter of 2023",

Annual Interest Expense: $137,132,000 (Note 10 - Earnings per Share, Non-operating (income) expense, Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized for six months ended June 30, 2022)\n\nTo calculate the interest coverage ratio, we use the formula:\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = (Adjusted EBIT) / (Annual Interest Expense)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = $1,461,804,000 / $137,132,000 \u2248 10.67\n\nTherefore, MGM's interest coverage ratio using FY2022 Adjusted EBIT",

However, we can infer the capital expenditure amount indirectly using the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows.\n\nIn the operating activities section, depreciation and amortization is listed as a non-cash expense, which is added back to net income to get the cash flow from operations. The depreciation and amortization for 2021 is $2,710 million. While this does not directly represent capital expenditures, it is often assumed that a significant portion of the capital expenditures will result in depreciation over time.\n\nSince there's no specific line item for capital expenditures in the statement of cash flows, we must rely on additional financial statements or management's discussion and analysis for a more precise figure. However, based on the available information alone and standard financial reporting practices, we cannot definitively state the FY2021 capital expenditure amount (in USD billions).\n\nGiven the constraints and the data provided, the best estimate we could make is that the capital expenditure might be around $27.1 billion, but this is an approximation based on depreciation and amortization and should be confirmed with additional financial",

Identify the CapEx (capital expenditures) for FY2022.\n3. Subtract the CapEx from the unadjusted EBITDA.\n\n### Step 1: Identifying Unadjusted EBITDA for FY2022\nFrom the provided filing, we can see the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net earnings. For FY2022, the adjusted EBITDA is given directly as $37,006 million. However, we need to find the unadjusted EBITDA, which is typically the adjusted EBITDA plus depreciation and amortization (D&A).\n\nThe filing shows that the depreciation and amortization (D&A) for FY2022 was $594.7 million. Therefore, the unadjusted EBITDA can be calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Unadjusted EBITDA} = \\text{Adjusted EBITDA} + \\text{D&A} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Unadjusted EBITDA} = 37,006 +",

The filing indicates that the majority of the net income in 2019 was derived from regular operations and includes adjustments for certain items such as purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition-related costs, but these are not considered extraordinary events. The largest adjustment noted was the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction, which negatively impacted the previously reported income by $6 million. However, it does not significantly affect the overall net income. The filing does not mention any other extraordinary events that would have substantially increased net income. [END OF REASONING]",

Acquisitions\\nTrillium\\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\\nArray\\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.', 'doc_name': 'PFIZER_2021_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 69, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that\\nsufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an\\naudit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash\\nwithin the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related\\ntax liability.\\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax\\nbenefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the\\nstatutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental\\n(non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible\\ndependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial\\npresent value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be\\ndetermined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the\\nobligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost\\nof providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are\\nmeasured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductionsnet.\\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related\\nlitigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal\\nand environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the\\nextent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the\\nrange, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range.\\nWe record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\\nT. Share-Based Payments\\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are\\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research\\nand development expenses, as appropriate.\\nNote 2.

We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since\\nthe lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which\\nconsisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\\ndevelopment expenses.', 'doc_name': 'PFIZER_2021_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 70, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\\nArrays portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-\\nlicensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3\\nbillion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing\\nagreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in developmentindefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technologyfinite-lived licensing agreements\\nwith a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of\\napproximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market\\nparticipant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year\\nended December 31, 2020.\\nTherachon\\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for\\nthe treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470\\nmillion contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset.

In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and\\ndevelopment expenses.\\nB. Divestitures\\nMeridian\\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in\\nDiscontinued operationsnet of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship\\nafter the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among\\nother activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period.\\nNo amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was\\nrenamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all\\nof the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received\\napproximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined\\nwith Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any\\napplicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the\\nUpjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan\\nshareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are\\ngenerally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an\\nindependent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and 3.60 billion aggregate principal\\namounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan\\nagreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash\\ndistribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate\\nprincipal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior\\nunsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued\\noperationsnet of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn\\nfinancing arrangements.\\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and\\nreflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn\\nBusiness, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net\\nincrease to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net\\ncredits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operationsnet of\\ntax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment\\nbanking fees.\\nPfizer Inc.\\n2021 Form 10-K\\n65\\n'}",

Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\\nsection within MD&A.\\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\\ncustomary closing conditions.\\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\\n38\\n'}",

It mentions separation-related costs but doesn't specify the total payment or final cost of the spin-off. Therefore, based solely on the given information, Pfizer's expectation for the total cost of spinning off Upjohn is around $700 million, though this might be subject to change. \n\nIf you're looking for the exact amount Pfizer expects to pay in the future, you may need to look at more recent financial statements or press releases from Pfizer. \n\nGiven the context, the closest answer to your question would be $700 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\nGENERAL\\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\\nOur Business and StrategyPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and\\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\\nprogram, see the Costs and ExpensesRestructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\\nsection within MD&A.\\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\\nhow our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a\\nnew end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining\\ntherapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\\nOur Business Development InitiativesWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy PortfolioIn July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\\ncustomary closing conditions.\\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\\nprograms by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\\n38\\n'}",

This additional revenue helped to further reduce the SG&A expense ratio.\n\n3. **Favorable Channel Mix Shifts**: The filing mentions \"20 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts.\" This suggests that the company's sales shifted towards channels that have lower SG&A expenses, contributing to the reduction in the overall ratio.\n\nWhile the filing does not explicitly state the exact year for these figures, the context and the comparison to previous years suggest that these factors contributed to the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent",

However, the filing does not explicitly state the reasons for this increase. Instead, it provides details on overall financial performance and inventory balances without breaking down the specific causes of changes in inventory levels.\n\nFrom the balance sheet data provided:\n\n- **Merchandise inventories, net** increased from $1,499,218 thousand at the end of fiscal year 2022 to $1,603,451 thousand at the end of fiscal year 2023.\n\nTo infer potential drivers of this increase, we could consider:\n\n1. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Retail companies often experience fluctuations in inventory levels based on seasonal demand patterns. If there was a significant increase in demand or planned for higher demand during the fiscal year ending January 28, 2023, this could lead to a higher ending inventory.\n\n2. **Strategic Stocking**: Ulta Beauty might have strategically increased its inventory to support its growth plans, including new store openings and expanding its product offerings.\n\n3. **Supplier Relationships and Lead Times**:",

Prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are generally amortized over the average remaining service \\nperiod of the employees expected to receive benefits. Expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the return on assets \\nassumption to the actual fair value of plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net in the year in \\nwhich they occur. These gains and losses are measured annually as of December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. Verizon management \\nemployees no longer earn pension benefits or earn service towards the Company retiree medical subsidy. See Note 11 for additional \\ninformation. \\nWe recognize a pension or a postretirement plans funded status as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. Also, we \\nmeasure any unrecognized prior service costs and credits that arise during the period as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive \\nincome, net of applicable income tax. \\nDerivative Instruments \\nWe enter into derivative transactions primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. \\nWe employ risk management strategies, which may include the use of a variety of derivatives including cross currency swaps, forward \\nstarting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, interest rate caps and foreign exchange forwards. We do not hold \\nderivatives for trading purposes. \\nWe measure all derivatives at fair value and recognize them as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our derivative \\ninstruments are valued primarily using models based on readily observable market parameters for all substantial terms of our derivative \\ncontracts and thus are classified as Level 2. Changes in the fair values of derivative instruments applied as economic hedges are recognized in \\nearnings in the current period. For fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in earnings, along \\nwith the change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments is \\nreported in Other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For net \\ninvestment hedges of certain of our foreign operations, the change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is reported in Other \\ncomprehensive income (loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment and partially offsets the impact of foreign currency changes on \\nthe value of our net investment. \\nCash flows from derivatives, which are designated as accounting hedges or applied as economic hedges, are presented consistently with the \\ncash flow classification of the related hedged items. See Note 9 for additional information. \\nVariable Interest Entities \\nVIEs are entities that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from \\nother parties, have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations through voting \\nrights, do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. We \\nconsolidate the assets and liabilities of VIEs when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the party that has \\nthe power to make the decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or \\nthe right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\\n63\\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\\n'}\n\n{'evidence_text': 'Estimated Future Benefit Payments \\nThe benefit payments to retirees are expected to be paid as follows: \\n(dollars in millions) \\nYear\\nPension Benefits \\nHealth Care and Life \\n2022\\n$ \\n2,049 \\n$ \\n906 \\n2023\\n1,648 \\n883 \\n2024\\n1,097 \\n862 \\n2025\\n1,066 \\n850 \\n2026\\n1,034 \\n840 \\n2027 to 2031\\n5,097 \\n4,139', 'doc_name': 'VERIZON_2021_10K', 'evidence_page_num': 93, 'evidence_text_full_page': 'fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not leveled within the fair value hierarchy but are included in total \\ninvestments. \\nEmployer Contributions \\nIn 2021, we made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plans, $58 million of contributions to our nonqualified pension plans \\nand $885 million of contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans.

The filing provides information on the company's balance sheets, including its cash and cash equivalents, but does not include any information about the quick ratio, which is calculated by dividing a company's quick assets (cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable) by its current liabilities.\n\nTo assess Verizon's liquidity profile, we would typically look at ratios such as the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, and days sales outstanding (DSO). Since the quick ratio is not provided, we can still make some observations based on the available data:\n\n- As of December 31, 2022, Verizon had $2,605 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n- The current liabilities for the same period were $9,963 million.\n\nHowever, without the quick assets (which exclude inventories and prepaid expenses), it's impossible to calculate the quick ratio and thus assess Verizon's short-term liquidity position accurately.\n\nIn summary, while we can see that Verizon has a reasonable amount of cash and cash equivalents, we do not have enough information to determine if the company has a",

Gains and losses from these \\ntransactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results as these items are included in the chief operating \\ndecision makers assessment of segment performance. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" for additional information \\nregarding Corporate and other results. \\nCapital Expenditures and Investments \\nWe continue to invest in our wireless networks, high-speed fiber and other advanced technologies to position ourselves at the \\ncenter of growth trends for the future. During the year ended December 31, 2022, these investments included $23.1 billion for \\ncapital expenditures, inclusive of approximately $6.2 billion in C-Band related capital expenditures. See \"Cash Flows Used in \\nInvesting Activities\" and \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information. We believe that our investments aimed at \\nexpanding our portfolio of products and services will provide our customers with an efficient, reliable infrastructure for competing \\nin the information economy. \\nGlobal Network and Technology \\nWe are focusing our capital spending on adding capacity and density to our 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network, while also \\nbuilding our next generation 5G network. We are densifying our networks by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions \\nand distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video \\nconsumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several \\nyears, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and \\nmobile 5G wireless services. 5G technology enables higher throughput and lower latency than the 4G LTE technology and allows \\nour networks to handle more traffic as the number of internet-connected devices grows. In January 2022, we began deploying C-\\nBand spectrum, which has been built out to cover approximately 189 million POPs in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022. We \\nexpect to continue deploying C-Band spectrum across the continental U.S. as more and more of the spectrum becomes \\navailable for our use. We use low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, to allow 5G service \\nto run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizons \\nmillimeter wave and C-Band coverage areas, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G technology using the lower spectrum \\nbands where this network is available. This allows us to more fully and effectively utilize our current spectrum resources to serve \\nboth 4G and 5G customers. \\nTo compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks \\nsupporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. \\nWe are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and \\nvirtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio \\naccess network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network \\nelements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-\\nefficient manner. \\nConsolidated Results of Operations \\nIn this section, we discuss our overall results of operations and highlight special items that are not included in our segment \\nresults.

The filing states that \"Capital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges.\" This indicates significant investment in capital assets, which is characteristic of a capital-intensive business.\n\nMoreover, the \"Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\" section reveals substantial capital expenditures in the recent past. Specifically, the document mentions that capital expenditures relate to increasing network efficiency, maintaining infrastructure, introducing new products and services, and responding to competitive challenges. These activities require substantial upfront investments in capital assets, which further supports the conclusion that Verizon operates in a capital-intensive industry.\n\nIn summary, the emphasis on capital expenditures and the nature of these expenditures indicate that Verizon is a capital-intensive business.
